**제목**: Thesis Research Plan: Guidance Request on Conceptual and Methodological Decisions

---

Dear Professor [PI 이름],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your guidance on my undergraduate thesis research examining the cognitive effects of hate speech on sentence processing, memory, and reproduction.

**Background**: I recently completed a behavioral experiment using self-paced reading with 탈렌족 (fictional group) as stimuli, testing how hate/derogatory modifiers (vs. neutral) affect online processing, plausibility judgments, and free recall. I received valuable feedback from Professor Daniel Plesniak highlighting several conceptual and methodological issues that I would like to discuss with you.

**Key Issues Requiring Your Input**:

1. **Conceptual Definition** (most urgent)
   - Current framing: "hate speech"
   - Problem: Lack of contextual information makes hate speech classification ambiguous in experimental setting with fictional groups
   - Options under consideration:
     - Maintain "hate speech" with strengthened operational definition
     - Reframe as "negative group-directed language" (more neutral, operationally clear)
     - Reframe as "emotionally negative language" (aligns with emotion literature)
   - **Question**: Which approach would be most appropriate for (a) thesis defense and (b) future publication?

2. **Effect Size Interpretation**
   - Observed RT increase: ~4% (≈25ms) in modifier region, Cohen's d ≈ 0.3
   - Marginally significant in current sample (N=?)
   - **Question**: Should I:
     - (a) Defend current effect size by benchmarking against literature?
     - (b) Collect additional participants to increase power?
     - (c) Both?

3. **Experimental Redesign for Thesis**
   - Option A: Add objectivity dimension (2×2×2: Objectivity × Valence × Plausibility)
   - Option B: Add context manipulation (background passage variations)
   - Option C: Maintain current design with increased sample size
   - **Question**: Which direction aligns best with thesis timeline and theoretical contribution?

4. **EEG Integration Timeline**
   - Question: Should the thesis include EEG pilot data, or focus solely on behavioral findings with EEG as future work?
   - Consideration: Graduation timeline vs. research quality

**What I Have Prepared**:
- Comprehensive roadmap document with short/mid/long-term plans
- Immediate action items (conceptual refinement, effect size re-analysis, literature benchmarking)
- Draft outline for Chapters 1-2
- All available at: `/Projects/lingThesis/`

**Meeting Request**:
Would you be available for a 30-45 minute meeting in early January to discuss these issues? I am flexible with your schedule and can meet in person or via Zoom.

I have also prepared specific questions and preliminary analyses that I can share before our meeting if helpful.

Thank you very much for your time and guidance.

Best regards,

## Version 2: 상세한 버전 (필요시)

**제목**: Request for Thesis Guidance: Hate Speech Processing Experiment - Conceptual and Design Decisions

---

Dear Professor [PI 이름],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your guidance as I develop my undergraduate thesis research on the cognitive processing of hate speech. After completing an initial behavioral experiment and receiving faculty feedback, I have identified several critical conceptual and methodological issues that require your expert input.

### Research Overview

**Topic**: Does hate speech affect sentence processing, memory encoding, and linguistic reproduction?

**Completed Work**:
- Behavioral experiment using self-paced reading (SPR) paradigm
- 2×2 design: Modifier type (Hate vs. Neutral) × Plausibility (Plausible vs. Implausible)
- Fictional group stimuli (탈렌족) to control for prior attitudes
- Multiple measures: word-by-word RT, plausibility judgments, free recall, manipulation check

**Preliminary Findings**:
- H1 (Attention capture): Hate modifiers → longer RT (~4%, d≈0.3) [marginal]
- H2 (Attention narrowing): Reduced plausibility effect in hate condition [partial support]
- H3 (Memory bias): Mixed results (lower accuracy for neutral facts, higher false alarms trend)
- H4 (Reproduction): Higher negativity in free recall after hate exposure [supported]

### Critical Issues for Discussion

#### 1. Conceptual Framework (Priority: Highest)

**Problem**: Professor Daniel Plesniak raised a fundamental question: What constitutes "hate speech" in an experimental context with fictional groups and minimal context?

**His key points**:
- Hate speech definition is highly controversial and context-dependent
- With real groups (e.g., describing historical practices as "barbaric"), context determines whether it's hate speech or moral judgment
- With fictional groups, participants may interpret negative descriptors as objective facts rather than hateful opinions
- Example: "미개한" (uncivilized) could be perceived as:
  - Hate speech: if targeting real marginalized group in contemporary context
  - Descriptive: if referring to ancient civilization's technological level
  - Moral critique: if condemning harmful practices

**Current Situation**:
- My stimuli: Subjective negative evaluations (열등한, 미개한, 저급한, etc.)
- Manipulation check: Measured "negativity" (부정성), NOT "hate" specifically
- Theoretical alignment: Currently relying on emotional language processing literature, not hate speech literature per se

**Options I Am Considering**:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Your Opinion? |
|----------|------|------|---------------|
| **A. Maintain "Hate Speech" + operational definition** | - High theoretical novelty<br>- Social relevance<br>- Aligns with initial motivation | - Requires extensive definitional work<br>- Vulnerable to conceptual critique<br>- Mismatch with fictional group paradigm | |
| **B. "Negative Group-Directed Language"** | - Operationally clear<br>- Fits current design<br>- Neutral terminology | - Less theoretically novel<br>- Distances from hate speech literature<br>- Weaker social implications | |
| **C. "Emotionally Negative Language"** | - Strong literature base<br>- Clear construct<br>- Easy measurement | - Loses group-directed aspect<br>- Generic emotional processing<br>- Limited social impact | |
| **D. Hybrid: "Hate-Related Derogatory Language"** | - Acknowledges hate component<br>- Permits narrower scope<br>- Honest about limitations | - Somewhat awkward<br>- Requires careful framing | |

**Questions for You**:
1. Which conceptual framing would you recommend for thesis vs. publication?
2. Should I conduct additional norming studies to assess perceived "hatefulness" (not just negativity)?
3. Is it theoretically defensible to study "hate speech mechanisms" without full socio-political context?

#### 2. Effect Size and Statistical Power

**Observed Effects**:
- Modifier region: Hate - Neutral = +25ms (4%), d ≈ 0.3, p ≈ .08
- Critical noun region: +15ms (2.5%), d ≈ 0.2, p ≈ .15

**Concerns**:
- Professor Plesniak noted: "The bigger issue is effect size. 4% might reach significance with more participants, but is it *scientifically* significant?"
- Current sample size may be underpowered

**My Analysis Plan**:
1. Benchmark against literature (Kissler et al., 2006: 30ms for emotional words; Ding et al., 2016: ?ms for negative verbs)
2. Power analysis to determine optimal N for d=0.3
3. Consider practical/theoretical significance thresholds

**Questions for You**:
1. Is d=0.3 a reasonable target for this type of manipulation?
2. Should I prioritize:
   - (a) Collecting more data with current design?
   - (b) Redesigning with stronger manipulation?
   - (c) Accepting small effects and focusing on pattern of results?
3. What N would you recommend for thesis vs. publication standards?

#### 3. Experimental Redesign Options

Given the feedback, I am considering three paths forward:

**Option A: Multidimensional Expansion**
- Add Objectivity dimension: Objective (e.g., "eat raw meat") vs. Subjective (e.g., "uncivilized")
- Design: 2×2×2 (Objectivity × Negativity × Plausibility)
- Rationale: Isolate hate-specific effects from general negativity
- Timeline: ~3 months for norming + data collection
- Risk: Complexity may dilute effects

**Option B: Context Manipulation**
- Vary background passage to provide hate-relevant context
  - Neutral: Anthropological description (current)
  - Threat: Describe intergroup conflict
  - Positive: Emphasize cultural diversity value
- Design: 3 (Context) × 2 (Modifier) × 2 (Plausibility), between-Ss for context
- Rationale: Address "hate speech requires context" critique
- Timeline: ~2 months for redesign + data collection
- Risk: Between-subjects component reduces power

**Option C: Optimize Current Design**
- Keep 2×2 structure
- Increase sample size (N=60-80)
- Strengthen manipulation check (add "hatefulness" rating)
- Add individual difference measures (prejudice, empathy)
- Timeline: ~1 month for additional data
- Risk: May not fully address conceptual critique

**Questions for You**:
1. Which option best balances (a) addressing critiques, (b) thesis timeline, and (c) theoretical contribution?
2. Can thesis include "imperfect but informative" study, or must redesign be completed?
3. Would you recommend pilot testing before committing to a direction?

#### 4. EEG Integration Strategy

**Original Plan**: Behavioral experiment → EEG replication

**Current Situation**: Behavioral data collected, but conceptual issues unresolved

**Options**:
- **Thesis Scope A**: Behavioral only, EEG as "future directions"
  - Pros: Manageable, allows time for redesign
  - Cons: Less ambitious, may seem incomplete

- **Thesis Scope B**: Behavioral + EEG pilot (N=10)
  - Pros: Demonstrates feasibility, richer discussion
  - Cons: Time pressure, EEG may inherit behavioral design flaws

- **Thesis Scope C**: Redesigned behavioral + EEG pilot
  - Pros: Strong foundation for future work
  - Cons: Very ambitious, risk of delays

**Questions for You**:
1. What scope is realistic for thesis defense by [June 2025]?
2. Should EEG wait until conceptual/design issues are resolved?
3. Can you facilitate EEG facility access if we proceed?

### What I Have Prepared

To make our meeting productive, I have prepared:

1. **Comprehensive Roadmap** (`THESIS_ROADMAP.md`)
   - Phase 1 (Immediate): Conceptual refinement, effect size analysis, literature review

## Version 3: 초간결 버전 (바쁜 PI용)

**제목**: Thesis Guidance Request - 3 Key Decisions Needed

---

Dear Professor [PI 이름],

I am developing my thesis on hate speech processing and need your guidance on three critical decisions:

**1. Terminology**: "Hate speech" vs. "Negative group-directed language"
   - Issue: Fictional groups + no context = ambiguous hate speech definition
   - Need: Your recommendation for defensible framing

**2. Effect Size**: Current d≈0.3, marginally significant
   - Issue: Small but comparable to literature benchmarks
   - Need: Collect more data vs. accept/defend current effect

**3. Design**: Maintain 2×2 vs. add dimension (objectivity or context)
   - Issue: Balance critique response vs. thesis timeline
   - Need: Your strategic recommendation

I have prepared:
- Detailed roadmap document
- Preliminary re-analyses
- Thesis outline (Chapters 1-2)

Could we meet for 30-45 minutes in early January to discuss?

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
